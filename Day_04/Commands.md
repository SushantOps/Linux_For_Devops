**1. ping** :- Test the reachability of a host on a network by sending ICMP echo request packets and waiting for replies.

**2. Netstat** :- Display network-related information such as active connections, listening ports, and routing tables on a computer.

**3. ifconfig**:- Configure and display network interface parameters, such as IP addresses, netmasks, and MAC addresses, on Unix-like operating systems.

**4. Traceroute vs tracepath** :-

**traceroute:** :- Determine the route that packets take to reach a destination by sending packets with gradually increasing Time to Live (TTL) values and noting the intermediate hosts.

**tracepath:** :- A simplified version of traceroute that provides the route packets take to reach a destination, displaying IP addresses of intermediate routers along the path

**5. mtr** :- `Combines the functionality of ping and traceroute, providing continuous and detailed network diagnostics by regularly sending packets and displaying statistics about the round-trip time and packet loss to each hop

**6. nslookup** :- `Query DNS (Domain Name System) servers to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and related DNS records.

**7. Telnet** :- `Establish a command-line connection to a remote server or device using the Telnet protocol, allowing interactive communication for troubleshooting or accessing services.

**8. Hostname** :- Display or set the name of the current host system in a network, often used to identify a device on a local network.

**9. ip**  :-  versatile command-line utility for configuring and managing network interfaces, addresses, routing tables, and other networking-related tasks on Unix-like operating systems.

**10. iwconfig**:- Display and configure wireless network interfaces, providing information about the current settings, such as SSID, signal strength, and encryption key, on Linux systems.

**11. ss** :- Display socket statistics, showing information about network connections, listening ports, and other socket-related details on Unix-like operating systems.

**12. arp**  :- Display and manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a network.

**13. dig** :- A command-line tool for querying DNS (Domain Name System) servers to retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and DNS records.

**14. nc(netcat)** :- Netcat, a versatile networking utility that reads and writes data across network connections, providing a simple way to transfer files, create network connections, and perform other networking tasks.

**15. whois** :- Interrogate the WHOIS database to retrieve information about domain registrations, including details about domain ownership, registration date, and contact information.

**16. ifplugstatus** :- Check the link status of network interfaces, indicating whether a cable is plugged in or unplugged, on Linux systems.
